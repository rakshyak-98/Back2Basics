- the kernel ring buffer is a critical data structure in the Linux operating system that stores messages generated by the kernel.
- serves as a temporary storage area for long messages related to the kernel's operations, enabling users and system administrators to diagnose problems and monitor system behavior.
- the kernel ring buffer operates as a circular buffer, meaning it has a fixed size. When new message are added, older messages are overwritten once the buffer reaches its capacity. This design ensure that the most recent kernel message are always available for inspection.
- messages stored in the kernel ring buffer include system boot logs, hardware detection messages, driver messages, and other critical kernel events.

```bash
dmseg -T; # print human readable timestamps for each message.
```
