## Why need migrations in Go (or any backend application)?
- migrations are necessary for managing database schema changes over time. They help in applying and tracking changes such as creating tables, modifying columns, or adding new indexes in a structured, version-controlled way.
- Rollback capabilities you can revert the database to a previous state if somethings goes wrong.
