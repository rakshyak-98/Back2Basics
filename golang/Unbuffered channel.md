An unbuffered channel in Go is a type of channel that does not store any data. It only allows communication between two go-routines when both are ready to send and receive a message at the same time. This ensures that the sender and receiver are synchronized during the communication.
- No Buffer: The channel has no capacity to hold values; messages are passed directly between the sender and receiver.
- Synchronization: The sender will block (wait) until the receiver is ready to receive the value, and vise versa.
