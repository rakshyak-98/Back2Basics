The difference between `\n` (Line Feed) and `\r` (Carriage Return) lies in their historical use and behavior:

---

| **Feature**          | **\n (Line Feed)**             | **\r (Carriage Return)**                                   |
| -------------------- | ------------------------------ | ---------------------------------------------------------- |
| **ASCII Code**       | 10 (Decimal) / 0x0A (Hex)      | 13 (Decimal) / 0x0D (Hex)                                  |
| **Purpose**          | Moves to the next line         | Moves the cursor to the start of the same line             |
| **Representation**   | Used as a newline character    | Used as a carriage return                                  |
| **Escape Sequence**  | `\n`                           | `\r`                                                       |
| **Primary Usage**    | Common in Unix/Linux systems   | Historically used in old systems and Windows               |
| **Behavior in Text** | Advances the cursor vertically | Moves the cursor horizontally to the beginning of the line |

### **Historical Context**

1. **`\n` (Line Feed)**:
	- Originates from typewriters, where it moved the paper up by one line.
	- In modern systems (Unix, macOS, Linux), it indicates the end of a line in text files.
2. **`\r` (Carriage Return)**:
	- Refers to moving the print head back to the beginning of the line on a typewriter.
	- In modern systems (Windows), it is combined with `\n` as `\r\n` for line endings.

### **Examples**

1. **Newline (`\n`)**:
```python
print("Hello\nWorld")
```

```txt
Hello
World
```

1. **Carriage Return (`\r`)**:
```python
print("Hello\rWorld")
```

```txt
World
```
- The cursor moves back to the start, so "Hello" is overwritten by "World".

1. **Combining Both (`\r\n`)**:
- Commonly used in Windows systems to represent a newline.

### **Platform-Specific Usage**

1. **Unix/Linux/macOS**: Use `\n` for line endings.
2. **Windows**: Use `\r\n` for line endings.
3. **Classic Mac OS** (Pre-OS X): Used `\r`.

### **Advantages & Disadvantages**

#### **`\n`**

- **Advantages**:
    - Compact: Single character for newlines.
    - Consistent across Unix-based systems.
- **Disadvantages**:
    - May cause issues when transferred to Windows systems.

#### **`\r`**

- **Advantages**:
	- Simplicity in its original context.
- **Disadvantages**:
	- Rarely used alone in modern systems.
	- Confusion when handling cross-platform files.
