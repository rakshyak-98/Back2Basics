- prototype property points to constructor property of the function you create and not to the build-in `Object()`.
- A *prototype* is an object and every function you create automatically gets a prototype property.
- prototype-based inheritance, objects can inherit properties and methods from other objects.
> [!NOTE] Prototype is an object (not a class or anything special) and every function has a prototype property.
