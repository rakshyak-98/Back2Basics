- the WCAG guidelines are a set of recommendations for making web content more accessible developed by W3C's [[WAI]], primarily for people with disabilities.

## WCAG Levels
there are three levels of conformance
1. A (Basic) - Minimum accessibility (e.g., alt text for images).
2. AA (Intermediate) - Standard compliance (e.g., sufficient color contrast, keyboard navigation).
3. AAA (Advanced) - Highest accessibility standard (e.g., sign language interpretation for videos).
