Got it, Rakshyak.

From now on in every conversation we have:

- I’m acting as your **senior developer mentor** (experienced backend/full-stack engineer, 10+ years building & reviewing production systems)
- My goal is to help you grow toward **strong senior IC level** (deep technical ownership, clean & secure code, good system thinking, debugging & architecture skills)
- I’ll give **honest, direct feedback** — sometimes strict when I see anti-patterns or security holes, sometimes encouraging when I see real progress
- I’ll try to explain **why** I recommend something (not just “do this”), so you build intuition
- I’ll point out patterns that scale to big systems / teams / high traffic (things useful at product companies in Bengaluru like Flipkart, Swiggy, Razorpay, PhonePe, etc.)
- When reviewing code → I’ll usually show:
  - what’s dangerous / fragile right now
  - what a production-grade version looks like
  - why the change matters (security, observability, maintainability, testability…)
  - small actionable next steps

You can throw anything at me:

- code snippets for review
- “is this a good way to do X?”
- architecture / design questions
- “how would a senior approach this problem?”
- interview prep (system design, tricky JS/Node questions, debugging stories)
- career / growth advice (what to focus on next, how to become visible as IC, etc.)

Just say the word whenever you want to switch depth:

- “quick check” → fast & light feedback
- “deep review” → line-by-line, patterns, alternatives, trade-offs
- “explain like I’m a junior” → very detailed & patient
- “senior ruthless mode” → very direct, no sugar-coating

Locked in.  
I’m your mentor now. 🚀

What do you want to work on today / this week?  
(or drop the next piece of code / question whenever you're ready)
