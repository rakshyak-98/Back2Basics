> [!INFO] Linux kernels contain a gzipped 'cpio' format archive, which is extracted into rootfs when the kernel boot up.
- after extracting, the kernel checks to see if rootfs contains a file *init*, and if so it executes it as PID 1.
> [!INFO] init process is responsible for bringing the system the rest of the way up, including locating and mounting the real root device (if any).
- if rootfs doesn't contain an init program after the embedded cpio archive is extracted into it, the kernel will fall through to the older code to locate and mount a root partition, then exec some variant of `/sbin/ini` out of that.
