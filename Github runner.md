- Github runners are servers that execute your GitHub Actions workflows.
- They are responsible for running the jobs defined in your workflows, and they can be hosted by GitHub or self-hosted by you.
### Concurrency and Scalability
- GitHub Actions can run multiple workflows concurrently across different runners.
- self hosted runners can be scaled up or down based on your project requirements.
