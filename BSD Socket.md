Berkeley sockets
- programming interface for network.
- communication in Unix-like operating systems.
- used for [[Inter Process Communication]]
- a client/server architecture is mandatory for BSD sockets.
- allow to add internet communication to products.

>[!NOTE] BSD socket is not stand-alone socket solution, an API relies on other socket communication for data exchange. Thus you always need to add TCP and UDP to project if you wish to use BSD sockets.
