An **autonomous program** is a software system that operates independently without continuous human intervention. It can make decisions, adapt to inputs, and execute tasks based on predefined logic or AI-driven learning.

### Key Characteristics:
- **Self-executing**: Runs without manual triggers after deployment.
- **Decision-making**: Uses logic, rules, or AI to adapt to changing conditions.
- **Self-correcting**: Can handle errors or adapt behavior dynamically.
- **Minimal human intervention**: Requires little to no manual control.

### Examples:
- **AI Agents**: Chatbots, autonomous trading bots.
- **IoT Systems**: Smart home automation.
- **Self-driving Cars**: Navigation and control systems.
- **Blockchain Smart Contracts**: Execute agreements automatically.
