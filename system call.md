> [!NOTE] System call are the primary means by which user applications interact with the kernel.
- these functions allow user programs to request services from the kernel, such as file operations, process control, and communication between processes.
- low level functions
- primary way for a program to interact with the operating system.
- __System call Table__ the Linux kernel uses a system call table where each entry is a pointer to a system call handler.
	- when a _system call_ is made, the kernel uses the system call number to look up the corresponding function pointer and execute the appropriate handler.

> [!INFO] When a program needs to request a service from the operating system's kernel, such as reading from a file, writing to a file, creating a new process,or communicating with hardware devices, it makes a system call.

> [!INFO] User programs operate in user mode.

### Computed calls
- process where the address of the function to be called is determined at runtime rather than at compile time.
#### how computed calls work
- __Function Pointer__ holds the address of a function.
	- the function to be called can be changed at runtime by assigning a different function's address to the pointer.
	- the function pointer is then used to call the function. Since the actual function being called can change, this provides flexibility and dynamism in program behavior.
- computed calls are crucial for implementing _polymorphism_ is __C language__.
	- _Structures_ can contain function pointers, allowing different structures to have different implementations of the same operations.

## `fsync`
- system call in operating systems that ensures data integrity by forcing data in memory buffers to be written to disk.
- commonly used in prevent data loss during power failures or crashes by synchronizing file content with the storage device.
### What happens middle of the `fsync` power failure?
If a power failure occurs during an `fsync` operation, **the data can become partially written**, leading to two potential outcomes:
1. **Data Corruption**: Part of the file may get corrupted. This is particularly common in file systems that do not handle atomic writes well, as only some of the fileâ€™s data blocks are written, leaving it in an inconsistent state.
2. **Metadata Inconsistency**: In addition to file data, file metadata (like size, timestamps) might be only partially updated. This mismatch can cause further corruption or prevent the file from being read properly.
### How File Systems Handle This Situation
To mitigate these issues, modern file systems employ strategies like:
- **Journaling** (e.g., Ext4, NTFS): Keeps a log (journal) of pending changes to ensure that incomplete operations do not corrupt the file. After a crash, the system can roll back to a safe state by referencing this journal.
- **Copy-on-Write (COW)** (e.g., ZFS, Btrfs): Instead of overwriting data, it writes to a new location and only updates metadata after the write completes. This approach ensures that either the old or the new data is intact after a crash.
