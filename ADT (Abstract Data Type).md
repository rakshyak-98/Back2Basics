- A data structure by its behavior rather than its implementation.
- it specifies the operations that can be performed on the data and the rules for those operations, without dictating how the data is stored or how the operations are implemented.

### Key Characteristics of ADTs
- Encapsulation -> ADTs hide the internal representation and only expose operations.
- Abstraction -> Users interact with the ADT without knowing its underlying implementation. 
- Well-defined Operations -> ADTs specify a set of operations, such as insert, delete, search etc.
