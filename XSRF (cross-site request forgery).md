The browser sends cookies every time you visit the site `bank.com`, even if the form was submitted from `evil.com`. So the bank recognizes you and performs the payment.
- This is a so-called “Cross-Site Request Forgery” (in short, XSRF) attack

All forms generated by `bank.com` have a special field, a so-called “XSRF protection token”, that an evil page can’t generate or extract from a remote page. It can submit a form there, but can’t get the data back. The site `bank.com` checks for such a token in every form it receives.

Binding to user session: XSRF tokens are ties to a specific user session. They are typically stored in the user's session data on the server side and are validated against the session data when a request is made.
