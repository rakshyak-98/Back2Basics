- **Atomicity** – transaction (all or nothing) Ensures transactions are all-or-nothing.
	- undo logs, roolback
- **Consistency** – DB moves from one valid state to another. Guarantees the database remains in a valid state.
	- constraints, triggers, application invariants
- **Isolation** – Concurrent transactions behaves as if serialised. Transactions execute independently.
	- locks, MVCC, isolation levels
- **Durability** – Committed data survives crashes. Ensures committed transactions persist.
	- write-ahead logging (WAL), fsync
