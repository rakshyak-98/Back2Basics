define an event handler for the user action events, this accepts a function, which will be called when the event is triggered.
- simple function passed as a value to another function.
- only executed when the event happens.
We can do this because JavaScript has first-class functions, which can be assigned to variables and passed around to other functions (called [[higher-order functions]]).
