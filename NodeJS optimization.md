## Profiling and Monitoring
- have an build in profiler, [clinic.js](https://www.clinicjs.org/)
- monitoring tool: [Relic](https://newrelic.com/), [AppDynamics](https://www.appdynamics.com/), [pm2](https://pm2.io/) application performance in real-time.
- Logging and monitoring to identify slow endpoints or functions.
- use benchmarking tools like [autocannon](https://github.com/mcollina/autocannon?tab=readme-ov-file#readme), [wrk](https://github.com/giltene/wrk2?tab=readme-ov-file#readme) to measure the performance of application under different loads.
## Efficient code practices
- Avoid blocking the event loop.
- Use clustering: Utilize the node.js cluster module to take advantage of multi-core systems by creating child process.
- optimizing data base queries.
- use tools like [node-inspect](https://nodejs.org/en/learn/getting-started/debugging) or [heapdump](https://github.com/paypal/heap-dump-tool) to identify and fix memory leaks in your application.
## Caching
- In-memory caching: Use in-memory caching solutions [Redis](https://redis.io/docs/latest/) or [Memcached](https://docs.memcached.org/) to store frequently accessed data.
- HTTP caching: Implement HTTP caching headers to reduce the load on server.
## Load Balancing
- User load balancer like [Nginx](https://nginx.org/en/) or [HAProxy](https://www.haproxy.org/) to distribute incoming traffic across multiple servers.
## Compression
- Gzip compression: Enable gzip compression to reduce the size of the response body and improve load time.
