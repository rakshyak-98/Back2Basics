an opcode (operation code) is the part of a machine language instruction that specifies to be performed.
- it tells the processor what action to execute.

> [!INFO] In assembly / machine code, an opcode represents an operation like `ADD` `MOV` `JMP` etc.

```assembly
MOV AX, BX ; Opcode for moving BX register value into AX
```

> [!INFO] In data transfer protocols, an opcode can indicate the type of message being sent (e.g., `0x01` for login, `0x02` for data request).
