- they help in reducing tight coupling.
- the major aim is to reduce the dependency of classes on each other.
- this help make code - reusable, maintenance.
### Single responsibility
- each class should have only one responsibility and one reason to change.
- the SRP says to separate the code that different actors depend on.
- aims to separate behaviors so that if bugs arise as a result of your change, it won't affect other unrelated behaviors.
### Open close
- open for extension and close of modification
- we should be able to change the class as per business requirements without breaking the code.
- abstraction is used to implement open to extension and closed to modification.
- abstraction feature tells the compiler that class is a blueprint and incomplete class (do not have body of function).
- extend a class's behavior without changing the existing behavior of that class. This is to avoid causing bugs wherever the class is being used.
