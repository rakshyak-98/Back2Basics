### File descriptors
- Standard input (stdin): file descriptor 0
- Standard output (stdout): file descriptor 1
- Standard Error (stderr): file descriptor 2

- when a program prints output, it writes to stdout, which is linked to the terminal or console by default.
- the kernel manages these file descriptors and routes output accordingly.

# OS File Descriptors

file descriptor

A **file descriptor** is a non-negative integer that uniquely identifies an open file or I/O resource in an operating system. It serves as a handle for accessing files, sockets, or pipes, allowing applications to perform read/write operations efficiently.

### Key Points:
- **Creation**: Generated by system calls like `open`, `socket`, and `pipe`[1][2].
- **Standard Descriptors**: The first three file descriptors are:
  - **0**: Standard Input (stdin)
  - **1**: Standard Output (stdout)
  - **2**: Standard Error (stderr)[2][3].
- **Usage**: File descriptors allow processes to interact with files without needing direct access to the underlying file system[1][4].
- **Management**: They are stored in a per-process file descriptor table maintained by the kernel, which indexes into a global file table[3][5].
