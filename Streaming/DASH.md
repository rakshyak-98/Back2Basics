- Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP (officially known as MPEG-DASH)

> [!INFO]
> - Is an open international standard for adaptive [[bitrate streaming]] of video and audio over the internet.
> - It allows high-quality media delivery from regular web servers (using plain HTTP) while automatically adjusting video quality in real time based on the viewer's network conditions, device capabilities, and available bandwidth.
> - DASH prevents buffering and freezing by dynamically switching between different quality versions of the same video (e.g., from 4K to 720p to 360p and back) mid-stream, without interrupting playback.
> - Everything happens over standard HTTP/HTTPS (port 80/443), so it works through firewalls, CDNs, caches — no special streaming servers needed (unlike old RTMP).
