- computer program
- directly executes instructions written in a programming or scripting language without requiring them previously to have been compiled into a machine language program.
#### Strategies from program execution:
1. Parse the source code and perform its behavior directly.
2. Translate source code into some efficient intermediate representation or object code and immediately execute that.
3. Explicitly execute stored pre-compiled [[bytecode]] made by a compiler and matched with the interpreter's Virtual machine.
> [!INFO] Source programs are compiled ahead of time and stored as machine independent code, which is then linked at run-time and executed by an interpreter and/or compiled (for JIT systems).
