is an event-driven I/O and light-weight concurrency library for Ruby. It provides event-driven I/O using the Reactor pattern, much like JBoss Netty, Apache MINA. Python [[Twisted]], Node.js `libevent` and `libev`.
### Two key needs:
-  Extremely high scalability, performance and stability for the most demanding production environments.
- An API that eliminates the complexities of high-performance thread network programming, allowing engineers to concentrate on their application logic.
- these combination makes `EventMachine` a premier choice for designers:
	- critical network applications.
	- web servers
	- proxies
	- email
	- [[IM (Information Management) production systems]]
	- authentication / authorization processors.
