- An analog interface is a connection that enables communication between devices through continuous signals, commonly used for transmitting real-world data like sound, temperature, or light intensity.

> [!IINFO] Unlike digital interfaces, which process binary signals (0s and 1s), analog interface handle a range of values that change smoothly over time, typically represented as voltage variations.
