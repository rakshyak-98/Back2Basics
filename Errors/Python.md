### `StaleElementReferenceError`
The `StaleElementReferenceError` occurs when the web element you are trying to interact with is no longer present in the DOM, or the reference to it is no longer valid (e.g., the DOM has been refreshed or changed).
This can happen when navigating through different pages or elements within a page (such as opening new folders in Google Drive) because the previously found element is no longer available
