- rank prediction involves predicting a continuous output or an ordinal label
- To handle this, you would typically use a **neural network with multiple layers**

### Advantages of Using Neural Networks for Rank Prediction:
- Non-linear Relationships: Neural networks can capture complex, non-linear relationships between features and ranks.
- Scalability: MLPs can be scaled with more layers to handle more sophisticated rank prediction problems.
- Flexibility: Neural networks can be trained for both continuous rank prediction (regression) and ordinal rank prediction (classification).

- ordinal labels
- data cleaning
- data normalize or scale features
- linear regression (Ordinal regression) or Gradient boosting algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM)
