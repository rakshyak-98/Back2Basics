Cross-browser communication typically occurs through APIs like Broadcast Channel and PostMessage, allowing different contexts (tabs, iframes) to exchange messages within the same origin. The Broadcast Channel API enables multiple browser contexts to join a shared channel for real-time data synchronization1.
CORS (Cross-Origin Resource Sharing) plays a critical role in securing these communications by defining how resources can be requested from another domain. It allows servers to specify which origins are permitted to access their resources, thus preventing unauthorized access and ensuring secure data exchange across different origins
