[linker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Linker_(computing))
- computer system program
- takes one or more [[object code]] (generated be a [[compiler]] or an assembler) and combines them into a single executable file, [[library file]] or another [[object code]]
>[!INFO] A simpler version that writes its output directly to memory is called the *loader*, through loading is typically considered a separate process.
### Overview
modules do not need to be contained within a single [[object code]] and  in such cases refer to each other using [[symbol]] as addresses into other modules, which are mapped into memory addresses when linked for execution.
