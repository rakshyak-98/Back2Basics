it is possible for a single-threaded programming language to spawn a child process. The ability to spawn a child process is a feature of the underlying operating system and the runtime environment, not the language's threading model. Even single-threaded programming languages can utilize operating system facilities to create new processes.
### How it works
in single-threaded programming languages, creating a new process does not require multiple threads. Instead, the language runtime or standard library provides functions that interface with the operating system's process management capabilities. The operating system handles the creation and management of child processes.
The operating system handles the actual process creation and management, making it possible for single-threaded languages to utilize these capabilities effectively. 
### Reasons for single-threaded languages
While the operating system can indeed manage threads for both types of languages, the choice to use one over the other has significant implications for software development.
- Single-threaded languages simplify programming by avoiding the complexities associated with concurrent execution, such as race conditions, deadlocks, and the need for synchronization.
- developers don't need to think about concurrent execution, making the code easier to understand and maintain.
- Languages like JavaScript, particularly in environment like Node.js, are designed for event-driven, non-blocking I/O operations, which are ideal for web servers and real-time applications where responsiveness is more critical than raw computational throughput.
- Many UI framework operate on a single-threaded event loop to avoid complex thread synchronization issues, ensuring that UI updates happen in a predictable manner.
- Single-threaded, non-blocking I/O models can handle a large number of concurrent I/O operations efficiently, making them suitable for network servers and applications that require handling many simultaneous connections.
