- mathematical function that maps any real-valued number into a value between 0 and 1.
- widely used in machine learning and logistic regression, specially in binary classification problems.

> [!NOTE] the output of the sigmoid function is always between 0 and 1, making it useful when you want to predict probabilities.

- S-shape graph: the graph of the sigmoid function has an S-shaped curve (also called a logistic curve)
