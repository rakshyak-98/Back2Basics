### 🧠 What Determines the Top-Tier Outcome

- **Not the years alone**, but:
    
    - ⏳ Depth of insight (can you debug kernel-level failures?)
        
    - ⚙️ Output leverage (e.g., design a compiler, database, or VM)
        
    - 🌐 Network + positioning (who uses your work? companies, researchers?)
        
    - 📜 Original contribution (standards, papers, tools, protocols)
