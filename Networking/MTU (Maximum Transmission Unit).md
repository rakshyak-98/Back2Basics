Defines the largest size, in bytes, of a data packet that can be transmitted over a network medium without fragmentation.
- In Ethernet networks, the standard MTU is 1500 bytes.

In an Ethernet network with an MTU of 1500 bytes, if a device needs to send a 1600-byte packet, the packet must be fragmented into two smaller packets to accommodate the MTU limitation.
