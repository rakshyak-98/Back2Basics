Whereas DNS focuses on simplification by using workstation names instead of addresses. 
The Network Information Service (NIS) focuses on simplification network administration by providing centralized control over a variety of network information.
- NIS store information not only about workstation names and addresses, but also about users, the network itself, and network services. This collection of network information is referred to as the NIS namespace.
## NIS Architecture
NIS uses a client-server arrangement similar to DNS.
