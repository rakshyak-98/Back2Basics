 A white-lable auth-URL flow is a method for user authentication that utilizes an external service's login system while maintaining the look and feel of the original application.
 **white-label** : This refers to the fact that the login process appears to be part of the original application. There won't be any visual cues indicating the user is interacting with a separate service for authentication.
 **auth-URL**: it's a unique web address provided by the external service that facilitates the login process. When a user clicks the login button on the original application, they're redirected to this specific auth-url.![/home/rakshyak/GitHub/news-homepage-main/assets/images/image-web-3-desktop.jpg](file:///home/rakshyak/GitHub/news-homepage-main/assets/images/image-web-3-desktop.jpg)
