- [thread](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thread_(computing)) is the smallest sequence of programmed instructions that can be managed independently by a scheduler, which is typically a part of the operating system.
- in many cases a thread is a component of a process.
- the implementation of threads and processes differs between operating systems.
- thread in the same process share the same address space. This allows concurrently running code to couple tightly and conveniently exchange data without the overhead or complexity of an [[Inter Process Communication]].
-  thread based networking is relatively inefficient and very difficult to use.
