## Interview Relevance
- **Interview probes:** Interviewers ask which composition pattern fits the API you want

## Sources
- [Summary pattern docs](https://react.dev/learn/thinking-in-react) — deep-dive
- [React Learn](https://react.dev/learn) — overview

## Key Concepts
- **Modern default:** custom hooks for logic reuse.
- **Keep for APIs:** compound components / providers when the JSX API matters.

## Technical Details
- See also sibling notes under `React Pattern/` and [[React design patterns]].

## Mistakes to Avoid
- **Mistake:** Introducing HOCs in greenfield 2026 code without a library const…
- **Mistake:** Provider for high-frequency changing values

## Pros/Cons or Trade-offs
- **Pro:** Shared vocabulary in code reviews.
- **Con:** Forcing a pattern where a simple hook suffices.

## Comparison
- vs [[react hooks]]: hooks share logic; these patterns shape component APIs.


### Use cases
- Reach for Summary pattern when the component API needs that composition style
