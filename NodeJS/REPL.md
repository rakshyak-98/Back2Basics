if `require.mai` is `undefined` in your NodeJS REPL, you're likely in REPL mode started with `node` directly, and not from a script file, so `require.main` is not set.

```js
const { pathToFileURL } = require('url');
const { argv } = process;
const fs = require('fs')

const __filename = argv[0] || fs.replpathSync('.');
pathTOFileURL(__filename).href;
```

> [!NOTE] `require.main.filename` returns the path of the file that started the REPL session (usually some internal Node REPL).
> - you won't get the current `command's virtula file` because REPL isn't a real file.

```mjs
// exmaple.mjs

console.log(import.meta.url);
