allow to update static pages after the site has been built without requiring a full rebuild.

- real time updates: keep content fresh without rebuilding the whole app.
- cost efficiency: reduces server load compared to full SSR.

- stale content: users may see outdated content until the re-validation happens.
- complex caching: requires careful cache management to avoid inconsistencies.
