- Edge orchestration coordinates AI models, applications, and resources across distributed edge devices, enabling dynamic deployment, updates, monitoring, and scaling in real-time without central cloud dependency.

- It automates model selection based on device capabilities, handless hierarchical processing (local for speed, aggregated for complexity), and supports collaborative intelligence where edges share insights securely. In industrial IoT, this manages unstable networks, containerized workloads, and fleets for predicitve maintenance or quality control, bridging legacy systems with modern DevOps.

### Tools for Industrial IoT

- Avassa - Centralizes management of thousands of edge sites with container orchestration zero-touch updates, and multi-tenancy for factories; strong demand from Industry 4.0 growth.
- ZEDEDA -> Open source EVE-OS for Azure IoT Edge, offers one-click deployments, zero-trust security, and Kubernetes support; scales for remote sites with high future adoption in smart manufacturing.
- KubeEdge -> Kubernetes-native for edge clusters, excels in lightweight orchestration over low-bandwidth; rising in IIoT for its maturity and integration with cloud-native tools.
- K3s (lightweight Kubernetes) -> Optimised for resource-constrained industrial devices, enables CI/CD pipelines to factory floors; future-proof for agile operations amid 17.4% market CAGR
