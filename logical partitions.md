- LPAR
- is a technology that allows a single physical server to be divided into multiple independent virtual environments.
- Each logical partition operates as if it were a separate physical server, computer with its own operating system, applications, and configurations.

- enables the division of a server's hardware resources such CPU, memory and storage, among multiple partitions. This allow each partition to utilize a dedicated set of resources tailored to its specific needs.
- each logical partition runs independently, operations or failures of one partition do not affect others.
- administrators can dynamically allocate and reallocate resources to logical partitions without requiring a reboot.
- support host different operating systems simultaneously, allowing organizations to run various applications and services on a single physical machine.

- consolidating multiple servers onto a single physical machine, organizations can significantly reduce hardware costs and maintenance overhead
- each partitions can be backed up and managed independently, improving disaster recovery processes
