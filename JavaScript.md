- tasks are handled sequentially within the same thread.
- JavaScript is synchronous by default and is single threaded within the same process.
- all tasks and operations and handled sequentially within that single thread.
- means code cannot create new threads and run in parallel.
- used to handle work that  will result in visual changes to the user interface.
- data can change constantly.
	- it would be extremely slow if the JavaScript engine had to check each time which data type a certain value has.
	- it can happen that the same piece of code suddenly returns a different type of data. If that happens machine code gets de-optimized, and the engine falls back to interpreting the generated byte code.

- includes features that allow it to handle multi-threaded operations.
- it offer a feature called [[web worker]] that can mimic multi-threading behavior.

> [!NOTE] data sent between workers and the main thread is copied, not shared. Objects are serialized and de-serialized, which can impact performance if large amounts of data are being sent.
