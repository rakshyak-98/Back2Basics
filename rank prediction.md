- rank prediction involves predicting a continuous output or an ordinal label
- To handle this, you would typically use a **neural network with multiple layers**
- predicting ranks is harder as the score distribution may be dense at certain ranges, leading to prediction uncertainties
- often, non-linear relationships where small score improvements at the top can lead to significant rank jumps
- In some cases, ranks might be divided into categories (e.g., top 1%, top 5%, etc.), making it a classification problem
- rank prediction is a classification problem
- for rank prediction the **Predicted vs Actual** plot will show how close the predicted ranks are to the actual ranks, giving a visual check of accuracy.
- combining multiple exam scores into a single composite score
### Visualization
- a histogram would show how scores are distributed across bins, while a box plot could highlight outliers or the spread between high and low scores. (bin size selection can distort the visualization).
- a Density plot is smoother then histogram, shows continuous distribution (may be harder to interpret for larger datasets).
- a box plot highlights outliers and data spread, easy to compare multiple distributions (doesn't show the exact distribution of data points within quadrilles).

> [!INFO] use histogram or density plot for initial distribution checks. And opt for box plots when dealing with multiple categories or to identify outliers.
### Advantages of Using Neural Networks for Rank Prediction:
- Non-linear Relationships: Neural networks can capture complex, non-linear relationships between features and ranks.
- Scalability: MLPs can be scaled with more layers to handle more sophisticated rank prediction problems.
- Flexibility: Neural networks can be trained for both continuous rank prediction (regression) and ordinal rank prediction (classification).
## Modal tanning
- ordinal labels
- data cleaning
- data normalize or scale features
- linear regression (Ordinal regression) or Gradient boosting algorithms (XGBoost, LightGBM)
- how to find the ranking loss?
- how to fine tune the data?
- These algorithms consider various factors such as **past academic records, extracurricular activities, and even personal statements to create a holistic view of each applicant**
# Questions (issues)
## How does a student score relates to score?
## How to know does distribution of marks happens?
## What are the factors contributing to rank?
## Can I use RAG in rank prediction?
## How to visualize relationships in the data?
## Why does the rank prediction will not supported with unsupervised learning?
- Rank prediction requires specific output labels (ranks), so it doesn't fit the unsupervised learning category where labels arenâ€™t provided.
- Unsupervised learning is more suited for tasks like clustering or anomaly detection, where the goal is to identify patterns without predefined outcomes.
