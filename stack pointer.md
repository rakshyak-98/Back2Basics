- specialized register in computer architecture
- stack pointer grow toward lower memory addresses
- decremented first before storing the item and incremented first before retrieving the item by this means the current pointer have the address to store a register value

> [!INFO] in many architecture x86, a dedicated register holds the SP, which interacts with other registers to manage function calls and return effectively

assembly call `Push` `Pop` opcode and oprant (register)
