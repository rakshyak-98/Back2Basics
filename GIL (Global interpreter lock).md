[GIL](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_interpreter_lock)
**Global interpreter lock** : A global interpreter lock is a mechanism used in computer-language interpreters to synchronise the execution of threads so that only one native thread (pre process) can execute one thread to execute at a time, even if run on a multi-core processor.
- application running on implementations with a GIL can be designed to use separate processes to achieve full parallelism, as each process has its own interpreter and in turn has its own GIL.
- otherwise the GIL can be a significant barrier to parallelism.
