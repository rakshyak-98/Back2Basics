Event-driven programming 
- programming paradigm
- flow of program is determined by external events.
- event like UI events from mice, keyboards, touch-pads and touch-screens or external sensor input.
- event like pro-grammatically generated (message passing) from other programs or [[thread]] or network events.
- used in [GUI](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Graphical_user_interface) applications and network servers.
In an event-driven application, there is generally an [[Event Loop]] that listens for events and then triggers a callback function when one of those events is detected.
