Berkeley sockets
- programming interface for network.
- communication in Unix-like operating systems.
- used for [[IPC]]
- allow to add internet communication to products.
- a client/server architecture is mandatory for BSD sockets.
- BSD socket is not stand-alone socket solution, an API relies on other socket communication for data exchange.
- thus you always need to add TCP and UDP to project if you wish to use BSD sockets.
