## Mental model

**Say it in one breath:** File based configuration manager is a design idea — I trade something off and I can name the failure mode.

## Standard config / commands

```bash
# sketch
# actors, data stores, failure domains
```

---

## Triage (when things break)

| Symptom | Check | Fix |
|---------|-------|-----|
| Hot key / hotspot | metrics by key | Shard or cache |
| Cascading failure | timeouts/bulkheads | Add limits and backoff |
| Split brain | fencing / quorum | Use consensus or single writer |

## Gotchas

> [!WARNING]
> Draw the failure mode before the happy path.

## When NOT to use

- Don’t over-design a CRUD application into Kafka+K8s on day one.
