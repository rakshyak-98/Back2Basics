## HLS vs. DASH: A Comparison of Adaptive Streaming Protocols
HLS (HTTP Live Streaming) and DASH (Dynamic Adaptive Streaming over HTTP) are both adaptive bitrate streaming protocols, but they have distinct differences:
- **Origin**: 
  - HLS is proprietary to Apple.
  - DASH is an open standard developed by MPEG, making DASH more flexible in terms of codec support and implementation [1][3].

- **Segment Format**: 
  - HLS typically uses MPEG-2 Transport Stream segments.
  - DASH employs the ISO Base Media File Format, allowing for lower latency and better compression efficiency [5].

- **Latency**: 
  - HLS traditionally has higher latency due to fixed segment lengths (usually 6 seconds).
  - DASH supports shorter segments, resulting in faster start times and lower latency overall [2][4].

- **Compatibility**: 
  - HLS has broad compatibility across Apple devices and many browsers.
  - DASH is not natively supported on Apple devices but works well on a wider range of platforms [3][5].

### Summary:
HLS is ideal for Apple-centric environments, while DASH offers greater flexibility and lower latency for diverse applications.
