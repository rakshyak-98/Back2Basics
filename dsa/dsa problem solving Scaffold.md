## Read and Restate the problem (Understand Precisely)

- Read the problem statement twice. Identify: What is the input? What is the output What are the constrains (e.g., time limits, array sizes, value ranges)?
- Restate it in your own words, as simply as possible. This exposes misunderstandings.
- Question: Why? Vague understanding leads to broken logic. Force yourself to articulate in clearly.

## Examples and Edge Cases (Build Intuition)

- Pick 2-3 small, concrete examples. Work them out manually on paper (or mentally, but describe it). What happens step by step?
- Identify edge cases: Empty input? Maximum/minimum values? Duplicates? Sorted/unsorted?
- Question: Derive patterns here. What repeats? What breaks naive assumptions?

## Brute Force Approach (Start Simple)

- Outline the simplest way to solve it, even if inefficient. What data structures? What loops or recursions?
- Analyse: Time Complexity? Space Complexity? Why is it brute force?
- Questions: This anchors your logic - optimise later, but prove you can solve it first.

## Optimise step by step (Derive Batter Logic)

- Identify bottlenecks in brute force. Where can you reduce redundency?
- Brainstorm patters: Sorting? Hashing? Two Pointers? Divide and conquer? Dynamic programming? Greedy?
- Build incrementally: Improve one aspect at a time. Justify why each change works.
- Question: Push for proof - why does this pattern apply? Use examples to validate.

## Pseudocode (Solidify Logic Blocks)

- Write high-level pseudocode. Break into functions or blocks. No syntax yet-just logic
- Walk through with an example. Does it match?
- Question: This is where mental blocks form - make each line explainable.

## Implementation and Testing (Execute Precisely)

- Code it in your language of choice (tell me which).
- Test with examples and edges. Fix bugs logically, not by guessing.
- Analyse final complexities.

## Reflection (internalise patters)

- What patterns did you derive? How does this relate to similar problems (e.g., sliding window for arrays)?
- What tripped you? How to avoid next time?
