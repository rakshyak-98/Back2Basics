- useful in situations where there is no infrastructure.
- a few people with no Internet connectivity setting up and [[ad hoc system]] to exchange documents or the member of a recovery team communicating among themselves in a disaster area.

	- video conferencing applications
	- distribution of pre-recorded TV programs
	- Linux distributions
	- game updates
	- live TV by parties legally authorized to distribute that content.

### P2P Architectures
- p2p systems are good option when there is no existing infrastructure adn deploying it is difficult for some reason.
- Disaster areas where existing infrastructures have been destroyed or rendered unusable can also benefit from p2p systems.
- since the system can leverage the processing and storage capacity of all the peers in the system, increase in the system's load are tackled by having the peers, user more of their processing or storage capacity.
- adding new peers generally increases the system's load but also increases the system's processing and storage capacity.
- there is no typical need to update any central servers to be able to deal with more users or more load.
