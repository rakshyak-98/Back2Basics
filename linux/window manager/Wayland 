Wayland and Xorg are both display server protocols used in Linux, but they differ in various aspects. Here's a breakdown of the key differences:

1. Architecture:

Wayland: Simpler, modern protocol where the compositor is the display server, handling both input/output without needing a separate window manager.

Xorg: Uses a more complex, older architecture that involves a separate window manager to handle input/output along with the X server.


2. Performance:

Wayland: More efficient as it reduces overhead by removing unnecessary abstractions. It directly communicates with the hardware.

Xorg: Higher overhead due to legacy code and multiple layers of communication between the window manager and display server.


3. Rendering:

Wayland: Each application handles its own rendering, and the compositor just displays the result, improving efficiency and reducing screen tearing.

Xorg: The X server is responsible for rendering, leading to more chances of screen tearing and lag.


4. Security:

Wayland: Offers better security as clients are isolated and cannot interfere with each other (no ability for one app to "spy" on another).

Xorg: Less secure, as all applications can potentially access the input/output of other applications.


5. Compatibility:

Wayland: Not all applications are fully compatible with Wayland, but itâ€™s improving. Older apps require XWayland (a compatibility layer).

Xorg: More widely supported and compatible with almost all applications, given its long history.


6. Extensions and Features:

Wayland: Supports modern features but lacks some legacy extension support compared to Xorg.

Xorg: Supports numerous extensions and customization options due to its age and widespread use.


Example:

Wayland is often used in newer Linux distributions like Fedora, while Xorg remains the default in distributions like Ubuntu, though both allow switching between the two.


Advantages of Wayland:

Faster and more efficient.

Better security.

Reduces screen tearing.


Disadvantages of Wayland:

Limited compatibility with some legacy apps.

Fewer configuration options compared to Xorg.
