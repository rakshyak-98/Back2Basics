IPC- Inter-process communication
- mechanisms provided by an operating system 
- for processes to manage share data.
- applications can use IPC, categorized as clients and servers, where client request data and the server responds to client requests.
### Approaches
Different approaches to IPC have been tailored to different software requirements.

## How does process communicat through port with external requests outside of os

Processes communicate with external requests outside of an operating system primarily through **network sockets** and **ports**. 

1. **Network Sockets**: These are endpoints for sending and receiving data across a network, using protocols like TCP or UDP. Each socket is associated with a port number, which identifies the specific process that should handle the incoming data[4][5].

2. **Ports**: A port number allows the operating system to direct incoming traffic to the correct application. For example, HTTP traffic typically uses port 80, while HTTPS uses port 443[4][5]. 

3. **Inter-process Communication (IPC)**: This includes mechanisms like message queues, pipes, and shared memory, allowing processes to exchange data even if they are not on the same machine[6]. 

This architecture enables robust communication between processes and external systems.
