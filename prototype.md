- A *prototype* is an object and every function you create automatically gets a prototype property that points to a new blank object.
- almost identical to object created with an object literal or `Object()` constructor.
- its constructor property points to the function you create and not to the build-in `Object()`.
> [!NOTE] Prototype is an object (not a class or anything special) and every function has a prototype property.
