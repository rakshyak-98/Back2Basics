> [!INFO] Reliable data storage for stateful applications.
- refers to a storage system that retains data even after the associated compute  resource (e.g., a virtual machine) is stopped or restarted.
- it is structured into fixed-sized _blocks_ that application can read or write directly, offering efficient and low-latency access.

- Block Level access: stores data in fixed-size blocks, allowing precise and efficient access.
- Attachable to compute instance: can be attached/detached to virtual machines as needed.
- Scalability: can be resized or adjusted to fit application requirements.

> [!INFO] Backup support: Enables snapshots or backups for data protection.

> [!INFO] High performance for transactional workloads.
