- specialized register in computer architecture
- stack pointer grow toward lower memory addresses
- decremented first before storing the item and incremented first before retrieving the item by this means the current pointer have the address to store a register value

> [!INFO] in many architecture x86, a dedicated register holds the SP, which interacts with other registers to manage function calls and return effectively

assembly call `Push` `Pop` opcode and oprant (register)
### Data register
### Flag register
### Address register
### link register
## index register
## instruction branch and jump
## Program counter (ARM) or Instruction Pointer
- Program Counter (PC) in ARM architecture
- Instruction Pointer (IP) also know as EIP / RIP in Intel architectures
- special-purpose register that holds the memory address of the next instruction to be executed by the CPU
- it ensure the CPU knows where it is in the program and what instruction to execute next
