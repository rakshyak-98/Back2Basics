Given an array of positive integers arr[], return the second largest element from the array. If the second largest element doesn't exist then return -1.

Note: The second largest element should not be equal to the largest element.

Examples:

Input: arr[] = [12, 35, 1, 10, 34, 1]
Output: 34
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 35 and the second largest element is 34.

Input: arr[] = [10, 5, 10]
Output: 5
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element is 5.

Input: arr[] = [10, 10, 10]
Output: -1
Explanation: The largest element of the array is 10 and the second largest element does not exist.

Given an array **arr[]**. Push all the zeros of the given array to the right end of the array while maintaining the order of non-zero elements. Do the mentioned change in the **array in place**.

**Examples:**

**Input:** arr[] = [1, 2, 0, 4, 3, 0, 5, 0]
**Output:** [1, 2, 4, 3, 5, 0, 0, 0]
**Explanation:** There are three 0s that are moved to the end.

**Input:** arr[] = [10, 20, 30]
**Output:** [10, 20, 30]
**Explanation:** No change in array as there are no 0s.

**Input:** arr[] = [0, 0]
**Output:** [0, 0]
**Explanation:** No change in array as there are all 0s.

**Constraints:**  
1 ≤ arr.size() ≤ 105  
0 ≤ arr[i] ≤ 105

You are given an array of integers **arr[]**. Your task is to **reverse** the given array.

**Examples:  
**

**Input:** arr = [1, 4, 3, 2, 6, 5]
**Output:** [5, 6, 2, 3, 4, 1]  
**Explanation:** The elements of the array are 1 4 3 2 6 5. After reversing the array, the first element goes to the last position, the second element goes to the second last position and so on. Hence, the answer is 5 6 2 3 4 1.

**Input**: arr = [4, 5, 2]
**Output:** [2, 5, 4]  
**Explanation:** The elements of the array are 4 5 2. The reversed array will be 2 5 4.  

**Input**: arr = [1]
**Output:** [1]  
**Explanation:** The array has only single element, hence the reversed array is same as the original.

**Constraints:  
**1<=arr.size()<=105  
0<=arr[i]<=105

Given an unsorted array _arr[]__**.**_ Rotate the array to the left (counter-clockwise direction) by _d_ steps, where _d_ is a positive integer. Do the mentioned change in the **array in place**.

Note: Consider the array as circular.

**Examples :  
**

**Input:** arr[] = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], d = 2
**Output:** [3, 4, 5, 1, 2]
**Explanation:** when rotated by 2 elements, it becomes 3 4 5 1 2.

**Input:** arr[] = [2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20], d = 3
**Output:** [8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 18, 20, 2, 4, 6]
**Explanation:** when rotated by 3 elements, it becomes 8 10 12 14 16 18 20 2 4 6.  

**Input:** arr[] = [7, 3, 9, 1], d = 9
**Output:** [3, 9, 1, 7]
**Explanation:** when we rotate 9 times, we'll get 3 9 1 7 as resultant array.

**Constraints:**  
1 <= arr.size(), d <= 105  
0 <= arr[i] <= 105
