### Why a programming language needs a compiler?
- different hardware platforms (x86, ARM, RISC-V) require different instruction sets. Manually porting code to every platform is impractical.
- A compiler abstracts this hardware complexity. It generate **target-specific code** based on the architecture's capabilities.
