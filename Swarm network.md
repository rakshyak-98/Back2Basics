A swarm network refers to a decentralized, [[P2P (Peer-to-Peer)]] network architecture where devices (or nodes) collaborate to achieve a common goal.
 Swarm networks are commonly associated with distributed systems, file sharing, and blockchain technologies. They often operate in untrusted environments, meaning that the node may not always be trustworthy.
## Example of Swarm network
1. BitTorrent: A file-sharing protocol where files are broken into small pieces and shared across a swarm of peers.
2. Swarm in Blockchain: Some blockchain projects, like Swarm (a decentralized storage system), use the term "swarm" to describe a network of nodes storing data collectively.
