- The beauty of the composite pattern is that it allows for a harmonious symphony of distinct functionalities, each encapsulated in its own component yet all working together seamlessly.
- in this paradigm, one component acts as the conductor, orchestrating the flow of data and events through contexts, while other components plays its part with focused responsibility.
- Composite pattern offers a level of abstraction and flexibility that these methods often lack. By decoupling child components from their parent, the Composite Pattern  allows for greater reuse and easier modification of individual components.
- this pattern excels when UI components need to be reused and recombined in various ways.
