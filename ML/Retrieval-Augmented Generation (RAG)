Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) enhances large language models (LLMs) by integrating external knowledge sources to improve the accuracy and relevance of generated responses. It operates by retrieving pertinent information based on user queries, which is then combined with the LLM's internal knowledge to produce more informed outputs. This approach addresses limitations of traditional LLMs, such as outdated information and factual inaccuracies, making RAG particularly useful in fields requiring precise data, like customer service and scientific writing. Additionally, RAG allows for real-time updates without retraining the model, increasing efficiency and user trust through source attribution[1][2][3].
